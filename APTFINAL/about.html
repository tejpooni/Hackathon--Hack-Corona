                COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)
                COVID-19 is genetically similar to SARS CORONAVIRUS, which is the virus that has the outbreak in 2002.

                [spread]
COVID-19 can spread through the infectant’s saliva by coughing or sneezing
 The coronavirus that spread within the human are usually benign (doesn’t post high danger) and they cause common flu-like symptoms. 
Coronavirus spread quickly to others. 1 person with COVID-19 in average can spread to 2.2 other people, which as a person with flu can spread to 1.3 people on average.
From January 1st to March 9th, in just three month, the number of confirmed cases of people with COVID-19 grow to 109578 with 3809 deaths. 
The flu normally has a fatality rate of 0.1%, which makes COVID-19    8~35 times more deadly than flu.
The fatality rate of COVID-19 differs based on the age of the human. The older the person, the higher chance he/she is from dying from the virus and vice versa.
Fatality rate is also highest among people with bad health conditions compared to healthy people(the condition including: diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease etc.)
[growth]
The number of new cases in China and in South Korea are decreasing every day. This is caused by self quarantining, the increase in people’s concern and awareness.
COVID-19 can survive on some surface for over 1 or 2 days.
[symptom]
More than 80% of the COVID-19 infections are mild infections, some of which don’t develop the symptoms. For the rest, the symptom can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, which develops into pneumonia.
COVID-19 can cause severe lung damage, which can also lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The lung inflammation around the lungs is way too severe such that fluid built around the lung can cause the blood pressure to drop dramatically or known as septic shock and the body’s organs are starved of oxygen. ARDS and septic shock are the main reasons people die from COVID-19, and people who are risking getting those are: elderly, smokers and etc.
People who catch COVID-19 often get the symptoms 5 days later. (Incubation period is around 5 days, but many people debates around it)
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR TEST) can be used to detect COVID-19. A chest CT should also be done along this test to check for viral pneumonia. (Quick flu test can also help)
